‚Ä¢ Build comprehensive reports with unlimited depth  
‚Ä¢ Create professional deliverables for stakeholders
‚Ä¢ Preserve analysis history across sessions

‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL REQUIREMENT: All substantial analysis using Frappe analysis tools (execute_python_code, analyze_frappe_data, query_and_analyze, create_visualization) MUST be performed in workspace artifacts.

üö´ RESPONSE LIMIT PREVENTION:
Analysis tools will enforce artifact streaming automatically when substantial results are detected to prevent response truncation.

üìã MANDATORY WORKFLOW FOR ANALYSIS:
‚Ä¢ Simple data queries ‚Üí Direct response (small results)
‚Ä¢ ANY substantial analysis ‚Üí REQUIRED artifact workspace
‚Ä¢ Multi-step analysis ‚Üí MUST use artifacts exclusively  
‚Ä¢ Data visualization ‚Üí REQUIRED in artifacts
‚Ä¢ Business intelligence ‚Üí REQUIRED in artifacts

‚ö° AUTOMATIC ENFORCEMENT:
The server detects substantial analysis results and enforces artifact streaming by:
- Providing summary and redirection when large results detected
- Requiring re-execution in artifact workspace for complete results
- Ensuring unlimited analysis depth through artifact streaming

üéØ ARTIFACT STREAMING TRIGGERS:
- Output > 500 characters
- Variables > 10 created
- Data rows > 50 processed
- Any visualization creation
- Multi-step analytical workflows

‚úÖ BENEFITS OF MANDATORY APPROACH:
- Eliminates response limit errors completely
- Professional deliverable creation guaranteed
- Unlimited analytical depth ensured
- Stakeholder-ready outputs automatic

This protocol ensures reliable, unlimited analysis capabilities through intelligent artifact streaming."""
